      <p>Mother’s Day is not just a date on the calendar — it’s a celebration of unconditional love, endless sacrifices, and unwavering support. From lullabies to life advice, mothers have shaped who we are in ways we often overlook.</p>
      <p>Whether she’s working tirelessly behind the scenes or cheering you on from the sidelines, today is a chance to say thank you for everything. Here's to the mothers who do it all, silently and selflessly.</p>
      <p>Let this be a moment to pause, appreciate, and celebrate the woman who gave you everything — even when she had nothing left to give.</p>
